# Parentheses and Quotation Mark Checker
### Description
This program iterates through an Excel file and does two things.
1. Looks inside each cell and checks if the number of opening and closing parentheses match. If they don't match, a message is printed to the console indicating a what sheet and cell the mismatch is found at.
2. Similarly, the script looks inside each cell to see if there's an even or odd number of quotation marks. If there's an odd number,  message is printed to the console indicating a what sheet and cell the mismatch is found at.
### Usage
```python
python quotation_and_parens_check.py <filename>
```
